Quick Start Guide
=================

Typical Use:

A typical procedure for using this task is as follows:
1. Copy new or updated bundles to the Staging Area.
2. Run the Publish to Local Catalog script.
3. Test the result by running View Local Catalog.
4. Upload files in the Upload Queue to the server, if any,
   then delete the queued files. You can do this manually
   or by running Clear Upload Queue.


Details:

This guide describes how to use the catalog task to maintain
a catalog. It assumes one of the following use cases:

(1) You want to create a local catalog for testing purposes,
    so that you can verify how your plug-ins will appear
    in the official catalog. 
(2) You want to create a private catalog to host on your own
    Web site.

A catalog task consists of three folders and some script files
that automate catalog preparation:

Local Catalog
This folder will contain a complete local copy of your catalog.
It is created and maintained automatically. You should never
modify the files in this folder manually. If you are creating
a private online catalog, this folder will contain a complete
backup of the catalog. If you are creating a catalog for testing
purposes, this will be your test catalog.

Upload Queue
After your catalog is updated, any new or changed files will be
copied to this folder. If you are creating a private catalog,
these are the files that you need to upload to your private
catalog server to make the online copy up to date. Always
upload the catalog.txt file last.

Staging Area
This folder is where you will copy any new or updated plug-in
bundles that you wish to publish to the catalog. When the catalog
is updated, this folder is scanned for plug-in bundles. Any bundle
whose ID is either not found in the local catalog, or is newer than
the version in the local catalog, will be converted into published
form and copied into the Local Catalog.
